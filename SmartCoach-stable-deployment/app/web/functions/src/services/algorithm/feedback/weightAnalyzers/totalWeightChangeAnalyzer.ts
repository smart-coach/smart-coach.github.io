/**
 * We recommend staying within 15% of your starting weight when bulking or cutting. There is no
 * specific research to support this exact number, but in weight loss studies it is considered clinically
 * significant if you lose more than 5% of your starting body weight. There is no evidence-based 
 * percentage of body weight increase for bulking that is considered significant. An indirect marker could 
 * be body mass index (BMI) where you do not want to bulk until you fall into the obese category or 
 * cut until you fall into the underweight category for long-term health purposes. 
 * This yields an ideal BMI range of [18.5,30]. 
 * 
 * Some users may begin a nutritional phase with a BMI outside the ideal range. In this case, 
 * BMI feedback is only displayed if their BMI calculated with their starting weight and BMI calculated
 * with current weight are both outside the ideal range but they are in different BMI categories. 
 * For example, someone might have a fat loss goal and be obese with a BMI well over 30. It may be a
 * good idea for that user to take multiple nutritional phases to work their way into the ideal BMI range.
 * We want to make sure we are not constantly providing feedback that the user needs to start a new
 * nutritional phase when that may not actually be the case.
 * 
 * Some necessary constraints for this analysis include that the user must have entered records of
 * their height and weight for their profile which is necessary to calculate BMI, the log’s goal is not
 * maintenance, the log meets MDET and the user’s overall weight change aligns with their log goal. As
 * long as these constraints are met and the user’s total weight change over a log is clinically 
 * significant or their BMI falls outside the ideal BMI range, the feedback suggests they may want to
 * transition into a new nutritional phase and start a new log for that phase.
 * 
 * @param user The UserProfile object of the user that owns the nurition log.
 * @param log the nutrition log that the feedback algorithm is being run on.
 * @param logStats A collection of various statistics calculated in advance for the log.
