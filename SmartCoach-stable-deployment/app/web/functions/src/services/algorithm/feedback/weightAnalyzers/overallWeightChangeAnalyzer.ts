/**
 * If a user wants to gain muscle, they should be gaining weight to optimize their results, if a user
 * wants to lose fat, they should be losing weight to optimize their results and if a user wants to maintain
 * their current body composition, then their weight should remain roughly the same. 
 * 
 * This feedback is intended to make sure that the overall change in an user's body weight aligns
 * with their goal. To check this, the SmartCoachâ„¢ intake suggestion algorithm calculates if a user is
 * gaining, losing, or maintaining weight by looking at the difference between start and current weight. The
 * feedback tells the user that they are doing a good job if their goal is to gain muscle and they are gaining
 * weight, their goal is to lose fat and they are losing weight or if their goal is to maintain and they have
 * maintained their weight. Otherwise the feedback lets the user know that their current change in body
 * weight is not considered optimal based upon their goal and suggests what would be optimal.
 * Body weight change feedback is only provided if the log meets MDET. This is because of how 
 * start weight and current weight are calculated. At the beginning of a log, the two values will be very 
 * similar and the results of the analysis are very likely to tell the user they have maintained their weight 
 * even if it is too early to tell whether or not that is truly whats happening. Once MDET is reached and 
 * exceeded, the feedback from this analysis is more useful.
 * 
 * @param log the nutrition log that the feedback algorithm is being run on.
 * @param logStats A collection of various statistics calculated in advance for the log.
