/**
 * Step 3 of the SmartCoach™ intake suggestion algorithm calculates ABE for a user based upon 
 * the data they are tracking in SmartCoach™. An interesting statistic to display to the user that shows how 
 * much work step 3 of the algorithm is doing beyond the initial estimate produced by the SmartCoach™ 
 * RFR model is the percent change from BE to ABE. This is calculated as the absolute value of the 
 * difference between BE and ABE divided by BE. 
 * 
 * To make the feedback more interesting to the user who likely does not know the inner workings 
 * of the SmartCoach™ intake suggestion algorithm, the feedback title is TDEE adaptation and the 
 * feedback contains a message similar to “We initially estimated your TDEE was X kcal, based upon your 
 * physical characteristics, change in body weight and calorie intake, we estimate your actual TDEE is Y 
 * kcal”. This feedback is only delivered once MDET is exceeded otherwise ABE is not calculated.
 * 
 * @param user The UserProfile object of the user that owns the nurition log.
 * @param estimatedTDEE The estimated TDEE output by the TDEE estimation algorithm for the user.
 * @param logStats A collection of various statistics calculated in advance for the log.
