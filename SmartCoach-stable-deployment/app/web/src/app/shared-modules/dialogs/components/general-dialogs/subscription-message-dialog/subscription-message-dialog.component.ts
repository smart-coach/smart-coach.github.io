/**
 * Displays a message to the user about their subscription. This component is 
 * intentionally left open ended so that it can be expanded in the future but is 
 * only currently used to inform the user if their subscription is unpaid. This
 * component should be able to be closed as long as the user's subscription is 
 * active. At creation time, a title, message and whether or not to show contact
 * info are passed in as paramters to this dialog. Below the title message and
 * contact info are two buttons, one of which is the checkout button which is used
 * to take the user to the payment portal, the other is a close button that is 
 * only enabled if the user's subscription is active.
