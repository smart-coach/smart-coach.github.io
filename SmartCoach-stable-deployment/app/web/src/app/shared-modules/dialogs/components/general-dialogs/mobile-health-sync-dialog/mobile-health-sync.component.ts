   * for the variable and health kit does not, then it will not be overriden regardless of override status.
   * If the entry in healthkit has a value for the variable and the entry from the log has a value for the variable,
   * then it will only be overriden if shouldOverride is true.
   * 
   * Next a check is done to see if there is an entry for today, if not, an entry for today is created and pushed 
   * onto the list of existing entries. Then the helper lambda is called on the entry for today to fill it with data
   * from healthkit if applicable. 
   * 
   * A final check is done to see if the user has chosen to sync the entire log or just today. If they chose just
   * today, then nothing is done. Otherwise, the helper lambda is called on each entry in the log to pull in 
   * data from healthkit if applicable.
   * 
   * Once done, the user's log is updated in firebase and an algorithm feedback dialog is opened. If any error occurs,
   * during this entire process, a snacbar message is displayed and the dialog is closed. An additional check was added
   * to see if the user has permissions before trying to grab entries from healthkit to cover the rare scenario where
   * they change their permissions immediately after opening this dialog.
