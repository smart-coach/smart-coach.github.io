/**
 * Component used as an overview of the user's main log on the dashboard component.
 * Displays statistics and information that can be calculated without needing to make
 * a request to the energy payload firebase function. These statistics include starting 
 * weight, current weight, start date of the log, title and the log goal. At the bottom of the 
 * component are buttons that can be used to open the log, edit the log and open the log
 * management dialog. Below are the functional requirements for the component buttons and displayed 
 * statistics.
 * 
 * The log title is shown at the top of the component. If it overflows, a horizontal scroll
 * bar appears that lets the user scroll to see the whole title.
 * 
 * Next is start weight and current weight. A log’s start weight is calculated as the mean of the
 * logged weight for the first 1 to 7 entries in a log and a log’s current weight is the
 * mean weight for the last 1 to 7 entries. The number of entries used is not constant
 * because entries are only considered for the calculations if they are within 1 week of
 * the first entry or within one week of the last entry and have a record of the user's weight.
 * If there are less than 7 entries, the start weight and current weight is the mean of the
 * existing entries logged weights. Using means further mitigates the risk of wild fluctuations
 * in the displayed log statistics. Start weight and current weight will be the same value
 * until there are more than 7 entries in a log unless there are incomplete entries.
 * Start weight and current weight calculations will also include overlapping entries until
 * there are 14 or more entries in a log unless there are incomplete entries. If a log has 
 * no entries then no start weight or current weight is displayed. Extra steps are taken 
 * with incomplete entries (missing weight or kcals). Refer to section 6.2 of the algorithm 
 * documentation for more information.
 * 
 * Start date and latest entry are simpler. They are both dates. In general start date is the 
 * date of the first entry in the log and latest date is the date of the last entry in the log.
 * If there are no entries in the log, the date the log was created is displayed as start date and 
 * latest entry.
 * 
 * Log goal is required to be set at creation time and cannot be changed. It is one of 3 values.
 * Fat loss, muscle gain or maintain weight.
 * 
 * The open button will open the log in depth component.
 * 
 * The edit button will open the log edit / creation dialog.
 * 
 * The settings button will open up the log management dialog.
