/**
 * This components is a view to display a time period. A time period 
 * has a start date an end date and list of entries contained in that 
 * time period.
 * 
 * The list of entries in the time period is displayed as a table. 
 * Each row in the table represents one entry and each column in the 
 * table represents one attribute that entries have. 
 * 
 * Empty entries are not displayed. Any incomplete entries, meaning they
 * do not have a value for an attribute but the entry exists, will have a 
 * blank cell.
 * 
 * If a row is hovered over by the user, it should change the color of the
 * text in that row to the theme color. If the user clicks on the row, then 
 * an entry modify dialog is opened with that rows corresponding entries data 
 * loaded in the dialog. 
 * 
 * If the sort mode for this component is anything other than 'day', the component
 * will have a header that displays the beginning of the time period followed by 
 * a dash followed by the end of the time period.
 * 
 * If the time period is empty, which means the log is empty, then only one row with the 
 * current date is displayed.
