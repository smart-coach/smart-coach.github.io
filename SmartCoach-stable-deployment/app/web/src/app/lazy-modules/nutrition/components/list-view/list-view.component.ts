/**
 * This component is responsible for everything on the right side of the nutrition-log in-depth display component.
 *  It is essentially a container for the log's list of day entries.  At the top of the component are controls for
 *  sorting and ordering the entries in the day entry list. Below that is a button that lets the user add a new entry
 *  to their log. Below that button is the list of day entries for the log being observed. 
 * 
 *  The control for sort mode lets the user pick a period of time to ‘chunk’ their entries into. For example, if ‘week’
 *  is chosen as the sort mode, then all entries are grouped into 7 day blocks. If ‘day’ is chosen, then all entries are
 *  grouped into 1 day blocks. 
 *  
 *  The control for order mode lets the user choose in which order the day entries are displayed. If descending is chosen,
 *  then the latest if first followed by the next latest in chronological order. If ascending is chosen, then the earliest
 *  entry is displayed first followed by the next earliest entry in chronological order. 
 * 
 *  The button for adding a new entry is referred to as the ‘auto prompt’ button. It was added to the user interface
 *  after working with Alpha users. If the log is empty, meaning it has no entries, then the current date is displayed.
 *  Otherwise, one day after the date of the newest entry in the log is displayed. If clicked, the button will open the day
 *  entry modify dialog for a new entry at the date displayed on the auto prompt button.
 * 
 *  If the user's tier is not allowed to have 'in-depth-stats' i.e. the value 
 *  of the inDepthStats member of the user's tier is not true, then they should only be 
 * allowed to have sort mode set to day and order mode set to descending.

  * we check the difference between the date of the entry in the list and the end date 
  * of the current time period. If the difference is less than or equal to one time period, 
  * then we add the entry to the current time period. Otherwise, there is more than one 
  * timePeriod between the current entry and the start of the time period which means it is 
  * not contained in that time period. Instead, we push the current time period onto the list 
  * of time periods to be returned. We make sure to check that the list of entries for the 
  * time period is not empty so that there are not any empty blocks of time displayed.
  * 
  * Then we create a new time period that begins one day after the time period we just pushed 
  * onto the return list ends. We also decrement the counter variable that is used to iterate 
  * through the log being observed's list of entries. This let's us reconsider the entry that we 
  * were just on to see if it is contained in the new time period we just created. This is repeated 
  * until the log being observed is exhausted of entries, then the final time period is pushed 
  * onto the return list and we return the list of time periods.
