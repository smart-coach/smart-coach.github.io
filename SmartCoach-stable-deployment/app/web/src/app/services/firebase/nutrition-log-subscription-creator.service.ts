/**
 * Creating and maintaining a subscription to an observable for a user's 
 * nutrition log is complex because the nutrition log's summary and entries are
 * stored seperately. This service is responsible for creating an observable for a 
 * log that will emit a new Nutrition Log any time that the state of log changes. 
 * This means that a new value is emitted any time that the log's summary or entries 
 * are edited.
 * 
 * It is expected that the class using this service will kill the subscription after 
 * it is done using the service using the kill subscriptions function. If the subscription
 * is not killed, then the same observable used for the last subscription will begin emitting
 * state changes for a new log.

  /**
  * Creates or resets a reference to a subscription to any changes to a log's summary or entries.
  * 
  * A log's entry and its summary are stored separately in the database. This means 
  * they need to be retrieved asynchronously from each other. This function sets a 
  * subscription to a log's summary and entries that updates an observable with the
  * new state of that log any time the logs summary or entries are modified. 
  * 
  * First check if a new observable is needed. A new observable is needed if the logid or 
  * the uid has changed since the last time this function has called. If they have not, then
  * return the current observable.
  * 
  * Otherwise, set the global logid and uid to match the new parameters. Then 
  * make a request to get the logs summary. In the body of the subscription, if the log's summary
  * does not exist, create a new log with the same properties as the summary. Otherwise, edit the
  * existing log to match the new log summary properties. If this is the initial request for the
  * log summary, a flag is set to indicate the summary has been received. Any error or null value
  * during this process will result in the log being set back to null. If both the summary and entries
  * have been received the updates are pushed through the observable.
  * 
  * Another subscription is set for the logs entries. Similar to the summary, if the entries are null
  * or an error is thrown, the log will be set back to null. If this is the initial request for the
  * log entries, a flag is set to indicate the entries have been received. Any error or null value
  * during this process will result in the log being set back to null. If both the summary and entries
  * have been received the updates are pushed through the observable.
  * 
  * Lastly, the global observable is returned as a promise. This is specicially done once the entries 
  * and summary are both received to avoid a situation where one arrives before the other causing the 
  * log to have a false state.
  * 
  * @param logId id of the log for the current user to get a subscription to.
