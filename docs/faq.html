						<p class="lsThemeText question">1. What happens if I miss a weigh in or forget to track my
							calories for a day?</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="lower">
					<p class="answer">Missing a day for tracking one of these variables is fine and it happens to
						everyone. If you forgot to track calories but still weighed yourself, then log your weight in an
						entry. If you forgot to weigh yourself but tracked your calories then still log your calories.
						Our algorithm knows how to factor in entries that are partially missing data.</p>

						<p class="lsThemeText question">2. What if I didn’t track weight and calories for a day?</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="lower">
					<p class="answer">You have two options. You can either log your calories and weight but leave them
						both empty, or you can just not create an entry for that day. Either way our algorithm will
						treat that day the same and it will not negatively impact your intake recommendations.</p>

						<p class="lsThemeText question">3. When my body weight changes should I update my profile?</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="lower">
					<p class="answer">You don’t have to worry about this. Every time you add an entry to your main log,
						we will check if your weight changed and update your profile appropriately. If you are doing
						your daily tracking in a log that is not marked as your main log, we would suggest that you mark
						it as your main log. That way you can take advantage of this feature.</p>

							calories I ate that day, or the day before?</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="lower">
					<p class="answer">For best results, we reccomend logging the number of calories you ate in a day in
						the same entry for that day. For example, if you ate 2500 calories on April 4th, then record
						2500 calories for April 4th's entry and not for April 5th.</p>

						<p class="lsThemeText question">5. Does it matter what time of the day that I weigh myself?</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="lower">
					<p class="answer">It doesn't matter when you weigh yourself, but it does matter that you are
						consistent with when you weigh yourself. This means if you always weigh yourself in the morning,
						don’t weigh yourself one day at night because you missed your morning weigh in. You would be
						better off leaving that entry with a blank weight and that way you won’t introduce an outlier
						entry with an abnormally high weight. Common times to weigh yourself is in the morning when you
						wake up, or at night before you go to bed. We recommend choosing the option that is easiest for
						you.</p>

						<p class="lsThemeText question">6. When should I transition into a new main log?</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<div class="lower">
					<p class="answer">We recommend that you start a new log for each nutritional phase. This allows our
						algorithm to make appropriate intake suggestions and reduces noise in the data you are tracking
						in LogSmarter™.</p>
