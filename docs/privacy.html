				<div>
					<p>
						Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have
						been collected for.

						Therefore:

						Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner
						and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
						Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained
						as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
						legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by
						contacting the Owner.
						The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
						consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
						be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the
						performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

						Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to
						access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability
						cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.

						If at any time you wish to revoke consent and/or request deletion of data, contact
						support@Logsmarter.net.
