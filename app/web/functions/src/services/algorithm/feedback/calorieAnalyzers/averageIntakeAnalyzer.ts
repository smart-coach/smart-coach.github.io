 * fall within the goal intake range. This analysis should not be performed if the

 * as a gentle reminder to the SmartCoachâ„¢ user that consistency with their calorie 
 * intake is a key factor in any body composition change intervention. This feedback
 * is provided as long as the user has enough data in a log to find a mean calorie
