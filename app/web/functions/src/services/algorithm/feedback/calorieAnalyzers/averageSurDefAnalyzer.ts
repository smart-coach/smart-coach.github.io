/**
 * SmartCoach™ provides preference settings for different cutting and bulking methodologies.
 * These preferences influence the goal intake range that is suggested by the SmartCoach™ intake
 * suggestion algorithm. This allows for an analysis of whether or not the user's mean surplus or deficit
 * aligns with their surplus and deficit preferences. This is calculated by taking the mean of the absolute
 * value of the difference between actual calorie intake and estimated TDEE. If the mean deficit or surplus
 * fits within the set range for the user selected preference then the feedback returns what the mean
 * surplus or deficit is and that the user is within the optimal range for their chosen preference. If
 * they are outside of the range, then their mean surplus or deficit is returned along with a suggestion
 * to try to fit within the optimal range. This analysis is the inverse of the mean calorie intake analysis
 * but is still a useful method of calculating the mean deficit or surplus for the SmartCoach™ user which
 * is not a statistic displayed anywhere else in the nutrition tracking user interface. It also accounts
 * for situations where the SmartCoach™ user may decide not to eat within their goal intak range every day.
 * For example an athlete may be in a cutting phase but have competitions during that phase. The athlete
 * may eat over their goal intake on competition day to improve their performance and under their goal
 * intake on another day to compensate. Some users may find it reassuring to see that their mean surplus
 * or deficit is still within their preferred range with a calorie cycling approach. This feedback is
 * provided as long as the user has enough data in a log to calculate a mean calorie intake and a goal
 * intake range. It is not provided if the users goal is to maintain because having a notable surplus
 * or deficit in a maintenance phase would not be optimal and if that is the case, the mean calorie
 * intake analysis will return the necessary feedback. Lastly, this feedback is also not returned
 * if the calculated mean surplus or deficit after the rate of weight change adjustment is negative.
 * 
 * @param log the nutrition log that the feedback algorithm is being run on.
 * @param user The UserProfile object of the user that owns the nurition log.
 * @param estimatedTDEE The estimated TDEE output by the TDEE estimation algorithm for the user.
 * @param logStats A collection of various statistics calculated in advance for the log.
