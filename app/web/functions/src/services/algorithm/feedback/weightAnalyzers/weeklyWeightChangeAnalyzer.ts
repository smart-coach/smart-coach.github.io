/**
 * Analyzing whether the mean change in body weight per week is appropriate for a nutritional 
 * phase is more insightful using percentages of total body weight rather than the actual amount of weight 
 * change. This is because the percentage is relative to the user's total weight and aiming for a fixed 
 * amount of weight change may not be appropriate given the size of the user. 
 * 
 * When a user's goal is fat loss, calorie intake should be set to a level that results in body weight 
 * losses of approximately 0.5% to 1.5% per week, depending on the amount of weight someone needs to 
 * lose. As a user gets leaner, they will need to reduce the rate to maximize muscle retention. When the 
 * goal is weight gain, recommendations range from 0.25% to 1.5% weight gain per month depending on 
 * the user’s training status which equates to 0.0625% to 0.375% weight gain per week. If a user's goal is 
 * to lose fat and they are losing at a rate of 0.5% to 1.5% of their starting body weight per week, the 
 * feedback tells the user they are doing a good job. If the user’s goal is to gain muscle and they are gaining 
 * weight at a rate of 0.063% to 0.38% per week, the feedback tells the user they are within an optimal 
 * range. The lower and upper end of the ranges for optimal gains in lean mass were rounded to the nearest 
 * whole number because the percent weight change per week is truncated to two decimal places. As an 
 * example, some of the most accurate bathroom scales on the market boast a margin of error of about 0.22 
 * lbs, this means even with the best equipment available to the average person, measuring body weight to 
 * multiple decimal places is likely to be imprecise. 
 * 
 * If the user's rate of weight gain or loss does not fall within the optimal ranges stated above, the 
 * feedback informs the user whether their rate of weight change is considered fast or slow and lists what 
 * the optimal range is. This feedback is not displayed if the user’s overall change in body weight does not 
 * align with their goal or their goal is to maintain. This prevents feedback similar to the body weight 
 * change analysis which already tells the user if their change in body weight does not align with their goal.
 * 
 * @param log the nutrition log that the feedback algorithm is being run on.
 * @param logStats A collection of various statistics calculated in advance for the log.
