/**
 * This component serves as the page that displays the user's profile 
 * information. It contains forms for editing profile data and updating
 * account preferences. It also contains the account component which will
 * redirect the user to a checkout session to update their subscription information.
 * The forms that update user preferences are in a sub component. Their functional 
 * requirements are described in that component.
 * 
 * Underneath the form for editing profile information are up to 3 buttons. An 
 * 'edit profile' button, 'reset password' button and a 'sign out' button. Ifthe  profile 
 * form is being edited, then two buttons will be displayed, a 'confirmation' button and
 * a 'close' button. 
 * 
 * The 'edit profile' button puts the profile edit form into edit mode and 
 * allows user's to update their height, age, weight, gender and activity level
 * through the profile edit form. This button is disabled if any other forms on the profile
 * page are being edited. This button is not displayed if the user has a free tier account
 * where the trial has ended, the user has a premium account but their subscription is not
 * active or if the profile form is being edited.
 * 
 * The 'reset password' button is only displayed if  the user has a free account with
 * time left in the free trial, the profile form is not being edited or the user has an
 * active subscription. If a form on the page is being edited, this button is disabled.
 * If the button is pressed, it will open the password reset dialog.
 * 
 * The 'sign out' button is displayed as long the user has a free account with time left in 
 * the free trial or they have an active subscription and the profile form is not being 
 * edited.This button is disabled if any other forms on the page are being edited. If pressed,
 * this button will navigate to the home page and set the auth state of the application to
 * unauthenticated.
 * 
 * The 'confirmation' button is only displayed if the profile form is  being edited. 
 * If pressed, the confirmation button will submit the values entered in the profile edit
 * form. When pressed, a spinner will be shown and hide all buttons in the profile edit
 * form. When the profile edit request returns, the spinner is hidden, the profile form is marked
 * as no longer being in edit mode and the result of the profile edit request is displayed.
 * Lastly, this button is disabled if any of the profile form controls are invalid.
 * 
 * The 'close' button is displayed if the profile form is being edited. If pressed,
 * the button will mark the profile form as not being edited and reset its state.
 * 
 * If the user's account is past the free limit or it is a premium account with a status that
 * is not active, a button will be displayed with a lock. If the user clicks on the button, 
 * they will be prompted by either the account warning dialog or the unpaid warning dialog.
 *  
 * Lastly, this component contains a 'delete account' button at the bottom of the page.
 * This button is only displayed if the user has a premium account and their subscription 
 * is active. If pressed, the user will be prompted with the confirmation dialog to make 
 * sure they want to proceed with account deletion.

export class UserProfileDisplayComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {

  /**
   * Group of form controls that make up the profile edit form. Contains controls to 
   * edit username, age, activity level, weight, height, gender and email. All controls in 
   * the form are pre-filled with the current user's profile information when this 
   * component is loaded. If this form is not being edited, then all controls are disabled and 
   * just used to display the user's profile information. If this form is being edited, the 
   * value of the form controls can be edited. Functional requirements for the individual
   * form controls are listed below.
   * 
   * Username must be a valid string less than or equal to 25 characters. A null
   * value means that no username was provided and will default to an empty string.
   * 
   * Activity level is a numeric representation of a user's physical activity. It is
   * split into 4 categories: sedentary, lightly active, active and very active.
   * Activity level will be equal to one of those four categories or null. If null,
   * no activity level was reported.
   * 
   * Height is stored in the user profile as a number of inches, but user's do not 
   * enter their height in this format. Instead the form controls displayed are based 
   * upon the users number system prefence. If the number system is set to 'imperial' then
   * two controls are displayed. One for feet and one for inches. For feet, the value must 
   * be an integer between 0 and 9, for inches the value must be an integer between 0 and 11.
   * If the number system is 'metric', then the only height control displayed is centimeters.
   * The value for centimeters must be between 0 and 302.3
   *    
   * Weight is stored in the user profile as a number of lbs, but users do not always enter
   * their weight in this format. If the number system is imperial, a form control for the 
   * number of lbs will be displayed. The value must be a number between 0 and 99997.3.
   * If the number system is metric, then a form control for a number of kg's will be displayed.
   * This value must be a positive number between 0 and  45358.0123. These awkward decimal numbers 
   * were chosen because they will always round down and prevent an innacurate floating point 
   * calculation from causing the number to round up when converting between imperial and metric.
   * it is unlikely that a user would switch their number sytem and have ridiculous weights entered,
   * but if they did and the numbers rounded up, they would violate the imposed constraints on 
   * weight.
   * 
   * Gender can be one of three values, null, male or female. If the form controls value is 
   * true, then the user is male, if the value is false, then the user is female, if the 
   * value is null, then the user's gender is unknown.
   * 
   * Age is stored in the user profile as a number of years. It must be an integer between 
   * 0 and 999. If age is null, then the user's age is unknown.
   * 
   * Email constraints are generally handled by firebase, but some basic checks are done.
   * The form prevents the email from being null, greater than 256 characters, being an 
   * empty string, not including an @ symbol or containing whitespace. Lastly, the email 
   * must be unique, meaning it can't be associated with another SmartCoach user. This 
   * check is done by firebase.
