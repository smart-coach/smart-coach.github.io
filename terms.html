					<p>Our Application allows you to upload, submit, store, and share data (“User Content”). You do not

						Content that you enter into our Application. As between you and SmartCoach™, you own your User
						Content. You hereby

						responsible
						for all User Content made available through your account on the Application or that you
						otherwise
						make available
						through the
						Application. For all User Content, you represent and warrant that you are the creator and owner
						of
						the User
						Content, or have

						under
						applicable
						privacy and
						intellectual property law) to authorize SmartCoach™ and other users to access and use your User
						Content as
						necessary to exercise

						edit
						or control
						your User Content
						or the User Content of any other user of the Application and will not be in any way responsible
						or
						liable for any
						User Content.
						SmartCoach™ may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block
						any
						User Content on
						the Application,
						including User Content that in SmartCoach’s sole judgment violates these Terms of Service or is
						otherwise
						objectionable. You agree
						to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you may have against SmartCoach™
						with
						respect to
						User Content.
						SmartCoach™ expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. If
						notified
						by a user or
						content owner that
						User Content allegedly does not conform with these Terms of Use, SmartCoach™ may investigate the
						allegation and
						determine in
						SmartCoach’s sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which SmartCoach™ reserves the
						right to do at any
						time and without
						notice.</p>

						YOUR
						NEEDS. WE

						terms of the Application, you
						should discontinue your use of the Application.These Terms control the relationship between
						SmartCoach™ and
						yourself. They do not create any
						third party beneficiary rights.</p>
					<p>If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean
						that we
						are giving
						up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
					<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
